# Weather App

Simple command-line weather application to find the basic weather info such as temperature, humidity, wind, and cloudiness. We just enter the zipcode as an argument. I'm using the OpenWeatherMap API (free tier) to get the data, which limits to 60 API calls per hour. 

# How to Run

`python main.py <zipcode>`
